## About Me
I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at UT Austin, advised by Kyle Mahowald, and a member of the CosmicAI Institute, where I work with Jessy Li. My research focuses on three main areas: (1) Mechanistic interpretability of vision-language models (VLMs), (2) Geometric analysis of (multimodal) LLM hidden states and the efficiency of representations, and (3) Leveraging VLMs to advance scientific discovery in astronomy. Before joining UT Austin, I earned my PhD in Computer Science at Brown University under Carsten Eickhoff, a Master’s in Complex Systems Modeling from King's College London, and a Bachelor's in Mathematics from the University of Aberdeen.
