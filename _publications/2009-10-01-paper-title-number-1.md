title: "IsoScore: Measuring the Uniformity of Embedding Space Utilization"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'In this paper, we demonstrate that existing measure of spatial distribution, such as average random cosine similarity, do not accurately measure the geometric property of isotropy. We propose IsoScore, the first metric in the literature that accurately measures the isotropy (uniformity of variance across dimensions) in point clounds. Using IsoScore on LLM representations, we show that models are highly anisotropic, and dominated by a small subset of high-variance dimensions.'
